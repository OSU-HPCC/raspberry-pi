Notice the rasperry pi doesn't have to think about 1,000 steps as hard, but our fractal doesn't look as nice. So let's split up the work. We're going to let each rasperry pi take on a part of the problem. We will let each pi do 1,250 steps each. Since we have eight pis, we will get 10,000 steps, but each pi doesn't end up working too hard. In this way, each pi helps contribute to a problem that was too big for it take on by itself.
