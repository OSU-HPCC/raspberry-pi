That's easier, but our fractal doesn't look as nice.
So let's split up the work. We're going to let each 
rasperry pi take on a part of the problem. We'll let 
each pi do 1,250 steps each. Since we have eight pis, 
we will get 10,000 steps, but each pi doesn't end 
up working too hard. Touch the screen when you're ready.
