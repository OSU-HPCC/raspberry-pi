Pretty cool right? Even though we choose the dots of the triangle randomly we get a triangular fractal pattern because we always use the same rule when we take a step (move half-way from the current point to the selected triangle dot).

So far, all of the work has been done by one raspberry pi. It was fast, but did you notice that it had to think a while for 10,000 steps? Let's give it a break and go down to 1,000 steps. First, feel free to check out the fractal. When you're ready touch anywhere on the screen.
