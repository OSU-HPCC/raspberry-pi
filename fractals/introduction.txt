Hi, and welcome to our raspberry pi supercomputer!
As you can see, there are three dots forming a 
triangle. We're going to take a "random walk"
 through the triangle. First, touch anywhere on 
the screen in order to pick a starting point.
Then touch any one of the three dots from 
the triangle. The next point will always be halfway 
between the last point and the triangle dot that 
you pick. Try randomly picking as many triangle
dots as you can.
