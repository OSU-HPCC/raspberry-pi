#Fractals

Engine for generating triangular fractals from a random path. Back end written in C++. Front end written in python.

Note: intended for a demonstration so runs on infinite loop. Between each iteration GUI stops and allows for user to make a keyboard interrupt on the terminal in order to halt the program.
